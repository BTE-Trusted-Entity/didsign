# DIDsign

DIDsign is a website that allows you to:

* sign electronic documents with your KILT on-chain DID directly in your browser,
* insert credentials as a part of the signature for these documents,
* use timestamping to proof the approximate time you signed them,
* verify documents that have been signed with a KILT on-chain DID,
* display additional information about the signer's on-chain DID, such as e.g. the on-chain DID, service endpoints that are associated with this on-chain DID and KILT credentials that have been made available via the service endpoints.

This works for single documents, or multiple documents.
